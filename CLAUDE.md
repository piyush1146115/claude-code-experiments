# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

I am following this Claude code course to learn and experiment with Claude Code: https://anthropic.skilljar.com/claude-code-in-action.

This is an experimental  project (`claude-code-experiments`) in early development, mainly following the claude code in action course. So far the language is JS. It involves some UI components as well.
